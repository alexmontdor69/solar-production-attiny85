# Check solar production with an ATTINY85
## Project Description

I would like to understand the production of solar panel in the area I'm living. Possibly use these findings to decide if i should invest in solar panel production.

What is better than a real test? In this repo, I will construct a solar panel test rig.

The would have to :

- Check the production on a real time basis

- Transmit the data to a server

The whole information should be able to be accessible from a web Browser
